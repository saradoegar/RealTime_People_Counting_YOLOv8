People Counting System

Real-time people counting system using computer vision and deep learning for public spaces.
Features

    ✅ Real-time people detection and tracking using YOLOv8
    ✅ Multi-zone management (draw, save, edit zones)
    ✅ Live video feed from webcam/IP camera
    ✅ Interactive web dashboard with statistics
    ✅ Person tracking with unique IDs
    ✅ Zone-wise people counting
    ✅ Export CSV/PDF of hourly/daily counts
    
System Architecture
Camera Feed → YOLO Detection → Object Tracking → Zone Processing → Dashboard

Modules

1. Video Input & Zone Management:
Capture video from webcam or IP camera,
Draw and manage multiple zones (ROI),
Save and reload zone configurations.

2. People Detection & Tracking:
Detect humans using YOLOv8,
Track individuals using unique IDs,
Maintain consistent tracking across frames.

3. Zone-Based Counting:
Assign people to zones using bounding box logic,
Count individuals per zone in real-time.

4. Dashboard & Visualization:
Display total count and zone-wise data,
Real-time charts (bar & line graphs),
Live statistics update,
Export CSV/PDF of hourly/daily counts.
